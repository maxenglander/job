<p>me being convinced taht my friend matt told me that his uncle wrote teh soundtrack to mortalkombat.</p>

<p>When bringing this up to him, or mentioning this false belief in conversation he laughed.</p>

<p>ahhahaha, I never said that.</p>

<p>His reaction was pretty convincing. Any doubt in my mind points.</p>

<p>A could be suspicious of him having told me this as a lie on purpose, but being super subtle laidback about it, so I think he&#8217;s telling the truth, then just to laugh in my face and call me crazy so i think i&#8217;m crazy. Could this have been his plan all along. What patience a plan like that would take. That is one senario.</p>
