me being convinced taht my friend matt told me that his uncle wrote teh soundtrack to mortalkombat.

When bringing this up to him, or mentioning this false belief in conversation he laughed.

ahhahaha, I never said that.

His reaction was pretty convincing. Any doubt in my mind points.

A could be suspicious of him having told me this as a lie on purpose, but being super subtle laidback about it, so I think he's telling the truth, then just to laugh in my face and call me crazy so i think i'm crazy. Could this have been his plan all along. What patience a plan like that would take. That is one senario.
